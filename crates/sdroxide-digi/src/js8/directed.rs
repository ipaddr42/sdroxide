//! What to answer, and — mostly — what not to.
//!
//! This is the only place in the JS8 implementation that decides to transmit
//! without an operator asking, so it is deliberately conservative. Every rule
//! here exists to stop the station doing something on the air that its operator
//! would not have chosen:
//!
//! * Only queries **addressed to us** are answered. A query to `@ALLCALL` is
//!   addressed to us; one to another callsign is not, however clearly we heard
//!   it.
//! * Only the commands upstream marks auto-repliable (`autoreply_cmds`) are
//!   answered at all. Everything else is displayed and left to the operator.
//! * A heartbeat is answered with a report only when the operator switched
//!   that on, and then only as often as the caller allows. A CQ is never
//!   answered: it asks for a contact, not a report, and starting one is the
//!   operator's decision.
//! * We never answer ourselves. One misconfiguration — an operator's own
//!   callsign arriving via a relay, or a loopback — would otherwise become a
//!   two-station beacon with no off switch.
//! * Answering is off unless the operator turned it on.
//!
//! Relay (`>`), the message store (` MSG TO:`, ` QUERY MSGS`) and the APRS
//! gateway are decoded and displayed but never acted on. They are out of scope
//! by choice, not oversight: each one makes this station responsible for
//! traffic it did not originate.
