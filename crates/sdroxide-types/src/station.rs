//! The persisted configuration that belongs to the *station* rather than to
//! the screen in front of it.
//!
//! Seven files, all written next to each other in the config directory and all
//! owned by the engine: the network cockpit (`net.json`), the two built-in
//! control servers (`rigctld.json`, `tciserver.json`), the WSJT-X UDP
//! broadcast (`wsjtx.json`), the operator's satellite additions
//! (`satellites.json`), the antenna-rotator client (`rotator.json`) and the
//! external transmit/receive switch (`relay.json`).
//!
//! They are bundled into one announcement because they answer one question —
//! "what is this station set up to do?" — and because a remote client has to
//! be *told*: it has no access to the machine the engine runs on, so a settings
//! dialog there would otherwise open on defaults and, worse, could write those
//! defaults back over the operator's real configuration. The engine emits this
//! once at startup and again after every change, so the answer is always the
//! current one, whichever screen asked.
//!
//! What is *not* here: anything describing the operator's own desk. The
//! control-input bindings and the UI settings stay client-side, because a knob
//! on this table has nothing to do with the radio in the other room.
