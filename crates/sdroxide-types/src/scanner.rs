//! Scanning: working through a list of channels, or a slice of a band, and

//! The unusual part of doing this on a software-defined radio is that it need
//! not be slow. A handheld scanner has one receiver and has to visit each
//! channel in turn, which is why covering 2 m takes minutes; here the FFT that
//! already draws the panadapter sees a whole span at once, so a range scan moves
//! the hardware one span at a time and reads every channel in it together. Only
//! a front end with no wideband IQ of its own — a CAT rig on a sound card — has
//! to fall back to visiting channels one at a time.
