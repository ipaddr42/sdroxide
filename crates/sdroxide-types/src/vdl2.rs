//! VDL Mode 2 domain types, shared by the native engine, the wire protocol and
//! the UI (native + WASM). Pure data + serde — the demodulator, the link layer
//! and the ACARS/XID parsers live in the native `sdroxide-vdl2` crate.
//!
//! # Why a message log and not a table of aircraft
//!
//! ADS-B next door is a room full of transmitters repeating themselves, so
//! [`crate::AdsbStatus`] folds every squitter into one row per aeroplane and
//! re-sends the table. VDL Mode 2 is the opposite: it is a *conversation*. An
//! aircraft sends a position report once and never sends it again, a ground
//! station answers, a link is established, a clearance goes up. Folding that
//! into "latest state per station" would throw away the thing an operator came
//! to read.
//!
//! So the decoder keeps two views and sends both. [`Vdl2Message`] is the log,
//! newest last, bounded by [`Vdl2Settings::max_messages`] — what was said.
//! [`Vdl2Station`] is one row per 24-bit AVLC address — who is out there, which
//! a scrolling log makes surprisingly hard to see on a busy channel. The
//! station's address is the *same* 24-bit ICAO number
//! [`crate::AdsbAircraft::icao`] carries, so an aircraft heard on both bands is
//! recognisably one aircraft.
//!
//! # The channels
//!
//! Seven of them, 25 kHz apart, and the decoder listens to all it can reach at
//! once — one downconverter each inside a single receiver window, the way the
//! ISM decoder covers its channel plan. 136.975 MHz is the Common Signalling
//! Channel, the one frequency in use worldwide; the rest are the European
//! group, where the traffic that does not fit on the CSC goes.
//!
//! # Sources
//!
//! ETSI EN 301 841-1 (the VDL Mode 2 SARPs, published as ICAO Annex 10 Volume
//! III Part I Chapter 6) for the physical and link layers; ARINC 618 for the
