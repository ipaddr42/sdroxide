//! The **WSJT-X UDP protocol**: sdroxide announcing its FT8/FT4 traffic the way
//! WSJT-X does, so the ecosystem built around it works unchanged.
//!
//! GridTracker, JTAlert, N1MM+ and Log4OM all listen for the same datagrams —
//! decodes, station status, and logged QSOs — on UDP port 2237. Speaking that
//! protocol means none of them needs to know sdroxide exists.
//!
//! The wire format is Qt's `QDataStream` (big-endian) behind a four-word header,
//! as defined by WSJT-X's `NetworkMessage.hpp`. All of it is built by pure
//! functions over a byte buffer in [`msg`], because UDP gives no feedback
//! whatsoever: a field of the wrong width doesn't fail, it just silently stops
//! a logger from seeing contacts. The tests are the only check there is.
//!
//! Output only. sdroxide is driven from its own UI (and from rigctld/TCI for
//! outside control), so the inbound half of the protocol — Reply, Halt Tx,
//! Free Text — is not implemented; nothing is read from the socket.
//!
//! NATIVE ONLY — it binds a UDP socket.
