//! Two receive antennas, one output: null a local noise source, or combine the
//! pair for the better signal-to-noise ratio of the two.
//!
//! # What "diversity" means here
//!
//! Two things, which is why this has a mode switch. Both start from the same
//! place — a second receiver, coherent with the first because the two chains
//! share one synthesiser and one sample clock — and they differ only in what
//! is done with the answer.
//!
//! * **[`DiversityMode::Cancel`]** is the QRM/QRN killer, the DSP form of what
//!   an MFJ-1026 or an X-Phase does with a knob: point a second aerial at the
//!   noise, and subtract what it hears from what the main aerial hears. The
//!   filter below finds the gain, phase and delay that make the two versions of
//!   the noise line up, and what is left is the band without it. What it costs
//!   is that anything *both* aerials hear equally goes with it, so the second
//!   one wants to be the one that hears the interference and not much else — a
//!   short whip by the offending switched-mode supply, a loop pointed at it, or
//!   simply the noisier of two aerials.
//!
//! * **[`DiversityMode::Combine`]** is diversity reception proper: two aerials
//!   on the same signal, added in the phase that makes them reinforce, weighted
//!   so the one with the better signal counts for more. On HF, where the two
//!   fade independently, this fills in the fades; the theoretical gain over the
//!   better branch alone is `1 + |r|²`, where `r` is the amplitude ratio
//!   between them — 3 dB for two equal aerials, and much more when one of them
//!   is momentarily in a null.
//!
//! # One filter, two arithmetics
//!
//! Both modes run the same adaptive filter and differ in one line at the end.
//!
//! The filter is a normalised LMS transversal filter `W` fed by the auxiliary
//! channel and driven by the error against the main one:
//!
//! ```text
//! y[n] = Σ_k w[k] · aux[n−k]
//! e[n] = main[n] − y[n]
//! w[k] += mu · e[n] · conj(aux[n−k]) / (Σ|aux|² + ε)
//! ```
//!
//! It converges on the Wiener solution: `W` becomes the transfer function that
//! turns the auxiliary channel into whatever part of the main channel can be
//! predicted from it — which is exactly the common signal, whether that is a
//! noise source or a station.
//!
//! **Multi-tap on purpose.** A single complex weight is a gain and a phase, and
//! that is all a knob-and-potentiometer canceller has; it nulls at one
//! frequency and gets steadily worse either side of it. Over the megahertz of
//! span an SDR shows, two aerials with different feedlines differ in *delay*
//! too, and a delay is a phase that turns with frequency. Each tap buys one
//! sample period of the difference the filter can equalise, so a handful of
//! them is the difference between a notch and a band that is quiet all the way
//! across. They are not free — see [`Diversity::cost_note`].
//!
//! Then:
//!
//! * `Cancel` outputs the error itself, `main − W·aux`: the common part
//!   removed.
//! * `Combine` outputs `(‖W‖²·main + W·aux) / (1 + ‖W‖²)`. That is
//!   maximal-ratio combining written in terms of the same filter: `W·aux` is
//!   the auxiliary channel referred to the main one's scale, and weighting the
//!   two branches by the inverse of their noise powers — which is what the
//!   `‖W‖²` and the `1` are — is what makes the sum optimal rather than merely
//!   in phase. It assumes the two branches have **comparable noise floors**,
//!   so the auxiliary chain's gain is a real setting and not a convenience:
//!   set it so the band noise reads about the same on both.
//!
//! # What it cannot do
//!
//! Nothing here separates a wanted signal from an unwanted one; the filter only
//! knows what the two channels have in common. Point both aerials at the same
//! thing in `Cancel` and it will dutifully cancel the station you are listening
//! to. The honest workflow is to watch the waterfall while it converges, and
//! [`Diversity::set_frozen`] the moment it has: a converged null holds while
//! the band changes around it, and a filter left adapting will re-aim itself at
//! whatever is loudest.
