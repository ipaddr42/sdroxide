//! A station reached through a reverse proxy that does not strip its path
//! prefix (issue #241).
//!
//! Putting sdroxide behind `https://host/sdroxide/` is an ordinary arrangement
//! and not an exotic one: a Tailscale certificate covers a host and offers no
//! subdomains, so a subpath is the only place a second service can go. Caddy's
//! plain `reverse_proxy` forwards the prefix untouched, and every request then
//! arrives naming something the router has never heard of — the page, the
//! bundle beside it, the radio listing and the socket alike.
//!
//! So the assertions here are made against the *prefixed* addresses, with the
//! unprefixed ones checked alongside: a station reached directly must go on
//! working exactly as it did.
