//! Stored frequency memories, marked along the bottom of the waterfall.
//!
//! One label per memory whose dial lands in the visible span, reading
//! `Mem: folder / name` — or `Mem: name` for an unfiled one — hung on a thin
//! vertical line at the frequency itself.
//!
//! Stacked inwards from the band-plan strip rather than over it, and packed
//! into lanes so that channels a few kilohertz apart stagger instead of
//! overprinting. What does not fit is dropped: the marks annotate the picture,
//! and a memory list deep enough to bury the waterfall would cost more than it
//! tells.
//!
//! # Clicking one recalls it
//!
//! The label is a control as well as an annotation (issue #320). A mark is a
//! channel somebody stored on purpose and then went looking for on the
//! waterfall; making them cross to the memory window to press it was asking
//! them to name a thing they were already pointing at. A click recalls the
//! memory whole — dial, mode and filter — exactly as the list does, because a
//! memory is a channel and not a frequency.
//!
//! Laying out and drawing are separate passes for that reason: the boxes have
//! to exist before the pointer is dealt with, several hundred lines before
//! anything is painted. Same split, and for the same reason, as the network
//! spot boxes next door.
