//! The QO-100 page of the SAT window: calibrate the station's frequency chain
//! against Es'hail-2's narrowband beacon.
//!
//! A page rather than a window of its own because QO-100 is a satellite. It is
//! the one this program can work without Doppler correction, being
//! geostationary — so what it needs instead is its LNB measured, which is all
//! of this. The window is [`crate::app::sat`]'s; only the body is here.
//!
//! The beacon this tracks — [`QO100_BEACON_HZ`] — is not a plain carrier: it
//! is a 400 baud differential+Manchester BPSK telemetry signal (AO-40
//! "uncoded" framing), which is why a magnitude peak search has no purpose
//! here — Manchester encoding leaves a *null* at the carrier frequency, not a
//! peak. The actual DSP lives engine-side, in `sdroxide_qo100` (raw IQ and
//! real phase information, neither of which the UI has); this page is a thin
//! front end onto [`sdroxide_types::Qo100Settings`] and
//! [`sdroxide_types::Qo100Status`] — the same split the ISM window keeps.
//!
//! Two jobs, split apart:
//! * **ON** runs the fast spectral tracker. Every second it looks in the
//!   operator's parking window (`+park_lo..+park_hi kHz`, shaded on the
//!   strip) for the beacon's two symmetric lobes with the null between them,
//!   and reports where the carrier sits — `null`, `sym` and `snr` say how
//!   convincing the shape was. It reads the beacon's *shape*, never its bits,
//!   so it works where the decoder cannot lock. **auto-correct** then closes
//!   the loop engine-side: on a clean, steady estimate it nudges
//!   `converter_offset_hz` so the beacon lands back on 10489.750 MHz and
//!   holds it there as the LNB drifts, deadbanded and rate-limited so a bad
//!   reading never yanks the receiver.
//! * **decode AO-40 telemetry** additionally runs the sync-word + CRC frame
//!   decoder, with a step-by-step readout (`carrier` → `sync` → `CRC`) of how
//!   far each pass got and how full the frame buffer is.
//!
//! When the decoder locks, the frequency it had to assume for the sync word
//! and CRC to check out *is* the station's whole frequency error — the LNB's
//! real LO plus whatever the SDR's own clock is off by, lumped together the
//! way an operator would correct them by hand. APPLY writes that correction
//! into [`sdroxide_types::RadioConfig::converter_offset_hz`] and reopens the
//! front end — the same round trip Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Apply makes — rather
//! than doing it silently on every lock, so a bad reading never yanks a
//! running receiver.
//!
//! The mini waterfall is visual context, not an automatic measurement: it
//! reads the same [`sdroxide_types::SpectrumFrame`] everything else on screen
//! already gets, cropped to a window around the beacon, so the operator can
//! see the Manchester null (and the search width buttons' effect) even
//! though nothing here hunts a peak in it. It does take one deliberate read
//! back, though — a double-click on the strip plants a "the beacon is here"
//! mark ([`Qo100WinState::manual_hz`]) that drives DRIFT and APPLY exactly as
//! a decoder lock would, for the case the null is plainly visible but the
//! demodulator will not lock.
