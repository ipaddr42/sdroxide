//! The same thing `--connect` does on the command line, without the command
//! line — and, because a station reached this way arrives as a radio tab of its
//! own, without giving up the radios already open here. The engine stays where
//! the antenna is; what crosses the network is the spectrum, the audio and the
//! commands.
//!
//! Native only. A browser client is already attached to the server that served
//! it and has nowhere to put a second connection, so there is no such tab
//! there — see [`crate::app::persist::load_remote_server`].
//!
//! What is edited here is the *screen's* setting, not the station's: it is
//! written to this machine's `config.toml` as it is typed, the way the control
//! bindings are, because there is nothing to apply and a pressed CONNECT is a
//! poor moment to discover the address was never saved.
