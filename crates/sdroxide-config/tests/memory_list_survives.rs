//! What a `memories.json` the operator cannot afford to lose has to survive.
//!
//! One test per file on purpose: `SDROXIDE_CONFIG_DIR` is process-global, and
//! setting it from a `#[test]` that shares a binary with others would race them.
//!
//! Issue #269: an operator upgraded, found every stored channel gone and the
//! folders still there — the two live in separate files, so whatever happened
//! happened to the list alone. Two paths could do that and both are closed
//! here.
