//! Moving a station's settings between installations, as one file.
//!
//! Everything sdroxide remembers lives as a handful of small files under
//! [`crate::config_dir`], which is fine until an operator has two of them: a
//! second machine, a club callsign beside a personal one, a rebuilt laptop.
//! Copying that by hand means knowing which files there are and where the
//! directory is on three different platforms, and doing it from screenshots
//! means not copying it at all (issue #356).
//!
//! # What travels
//!
//! Every settings file in the config directory and in each radio's
//! `radio-<n>/` subdirectory, carried **verbatim** — the text as it is on the
//! disk, not a re-serialisation of a parsed value. A bundle written by a newer
//! sdroxide therefore keeps settings this one has never heard of, and a field
//! added between two versions is not quietly dropped in transit.
//!
//! Two things deliberately do not travel, and both for the same reason: they
//! are not settings.
//!
//! * **The logbook.** [`SKIP`] leaves `qso_log.json` where it is. An operator
//!   moving settings between two callsigns wants their setup on both and their
//!   contacts kept apart, which is exactly what issue #356 asks for; a log that
//!   really is to be moved has ADIF, which every other program reads too.
//! * **A saved sign-in.** `remote_login.json` holds a password for a server
//!   *this* machine connects to, and a settings bundle is a file people email
//!   each other.
//!
//! # What an import may write
//!
//! A bundle is data from somewhere else, so [`import`] treats every path in it
//! as untrusted: a name has to be a plain file name with a known extension,
//! optionally under a single `radio-<n>/` directory, and anything else is
//! skipped and reported rather than written. Nothing can therefore be made to
//! land outside the config directory, whatever a hand-edited bundle says.
