//!
//! Every byte any of these boards is ever sent is built here, by functions that
//! take a channel number and a state and return bytes. Nothing in this module
//! opens anything, blocks on anything, or knows what time it is — which is what
//! makes the fiddly half checkable against a datasheet with nothing plugged in.
//! The same split every native driver in this workspace makes.
//!
//! # The channel numbering trap
//!
//! Everything above this module numbers contacts from 1, the way the boards'
//! own silkscreens do. Two of the five families disagree on the wire: Numato
//! counts from zero, and dcttech's HID relays count from one. The conversion
//! lives here, once, with a test per board width — it is the single most likely
//! off-by-one in the whole subsystem and it belongs in the half that can be
//! tested.
