//! The USB relay boards that speak over a serial port: LCUS, KMtronic, Numato.
//!
//! One transport for all three, because they differ only in what "close channel
//! 2" looks like on the wire and that is all in [`crate::frame`]. What they
//! share is more interesting than what they do not: none of them needs an
//! acknowledgement to have worked, all of them are a USB-serial bridge in front
//! of a microcontroller, and all of them are cheap enough that an operator has
//! two.
//!
//! # Why nothing here waits for a reply
//!
//! The LCUS never answers at all. KMtronic and Numato will if asked, but asking
//! at key-down would put a round trip between the operator's thumb and their
//! antenna relay for no gain: the reply says the board received the byte, not
//! that the contact has moved, and the contact moving is what the lead time is
//! for. So the write is the transaction, and the read-back is a separate
//! question the driver asks when it has time — to notice a board that has
//! quietly stopped agreeing, which is a different fault from a dead cable.
