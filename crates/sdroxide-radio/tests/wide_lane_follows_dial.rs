//! The main panadapter must go back to the I/Q once the dial has moved.

//! A front end that publishes a band-wide overview alongside its I/Q — an
//! RX-888's whole 64.8 MHz of HF, a KiwiSDR's 0–30 MHz — draws the main
//! panadapter from that overview only while the viewport reaches outside what
//! the I/Q covers. The test is containment, so it needs the centre the samples
//! in hand were taken at.
//!
//! On a front end that declares a stream delay the engine tracks that down a
//! trail of retunes. On every other one there is no trail to track: the samples
//! in hand are at the commanded centre. Reading the tracked field regardless
//! left it on the centre the engine opened at, so every later tune looked like
//! a viewport panned clean off the passband and the whole of HF was drawn from
//! the overview lane at some 16 kHz a bin — except in the one window the engine
//! had started in.
