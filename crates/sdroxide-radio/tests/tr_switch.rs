//! The external T/R switch against the engine, with a fake relay board.

//! Every claim here is one an operator is trusting with their receiver's front
//! end, so each is measured rather than assumed: that the contacts close
//! *before* `tx_begin` by at least the lead they asked for, that they open
//! *after* `tx_end` by at least the hold, that a refused key-down leaves them
//! exactly where they were, and that a second radio on the air holds them shut
//! while the first one unkeys.
//!
//! The board is a `RelayTransport` that records `(when, mask)`; the radio is an
//! `IqSource` that records when it was keyed and unkeyed. Both clocks are the
//! same `Instant`, which is what makes "before" and "after" checkable.
