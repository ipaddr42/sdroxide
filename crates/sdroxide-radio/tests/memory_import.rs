//! Importing a channel list (issue #234).
//!
//! Somebody with four hundred local repeaters is not going to store them one at
//! a time, and the file they already have is a CHIRP CSV — that is what every
//! repeater directory exports. What is checked here is the engine's half of it:
//! the channels arrive, the engine — not the sender — decides their ids, and a
//! second import of the same list adds nothing.
//!
//! One test function on purpose: `SDROXIDE_CONFIG_DIR` is process-global, and
//! this one writes a real `memories.json` under it.
