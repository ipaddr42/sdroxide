//! decode records the audio tone it arrived on and nothing about the dial, so
//! carried across a QSY it is not a stale label: clicking it moves the transmit
//! offset, and a station queued from it is called at that offset, both against
//! a dial that has moved out from under them. The engine's job in that is the
//! two things the client cannot reach — the call queue, which transmits by
//! itself, and the WSJT-X broadcast, whose clients hold their own copy of the
//! list.
//!
//! The distinction under test is band-level, not a delta on the dial: tuning
//! about within a band is the same opening and invalidates nothing.
