//!
//! The receive filter is ahead of the gate rather than behind it, which is
//! [`crate::demod`]'s note to make: it is what stops one channel's gate opening
//! on the other channel's ships.
//!
//! # The counters are the diagnosis
//!
//! An empty vessel list has half a dozen causes and they want completely
//! different answers: no aerial, an aerial for the wrong band, a receiver
//! parked elsewhere, a channel full of something that is not AIS, or a decoder
//! with a bit order backwards. [`Counters`] is arranged so that the *first*
//! stage that stops counting names the cause:
//!
//! - `bursts` zero — nothing is arriving. Aerial, or the receiver is not here.
//! - `bursts` up, `no_eye` equal to it — something is arriving and it is not
//!   GMSK. A carrier, a pager, a repeater's tail.
//! - `bursts` up, `bad_fcs` high, `frames` zero — it is a burst of *something*
//!   whose bits do not check. Marginal signal, or a decoder problem.
//! - `frames` up, `unsupported` high — real AIS, being read, carrying message
//!   types this decoder does not model. Nothing is wrong.
//!
//! # Why the bit phase is swept and why that is not a substitute for measuring it
//!
//! [`crate::demod`] measures the bit phase once per burst and is right about it
//! — [`crate::demod`]'s own test is what says so. The sweep here exists for the
//! bursts where the *measurement* is biased rather than wrong: one the gate
//! opened late on, one clipped by a fade at its tail, one with a second station
//! bleeding into its last slot. A fraction of a bit of bias is the difference
//! between every frame and none, and each extra try costs one pass of a slicer
//! over a couple of hundred bits.
//!
//! The order matters: the estimate is tried *first*, and the sweep stops at the
//! first phase that yields a frame whose check sequence passes. A phase that
//! produces a frame produced the right one — a sixteen-bit check standing over
//! a flag-delimited, octet-aligned run is not something a wrong sampling
//! instant arrives at.
