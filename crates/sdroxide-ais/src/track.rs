//! The vessel table: decoded messages in, one row per MMSI out.
//!
//! Everything a ship says arrives in pieces, and the pieces are minutes apart.
//! The position comes every two to ten seconds; the name, call sign, IMO
//! number, dimensions, draught and destination come once every six minutes in a
//! different message; a Class B unit splits even the name and the call sign
//! into two halves sent separately. This module is where those are folded into
//! one picture per station, and where the two ages that govern a target's life
//! on screen are kept.
//!
//! # The trail is trimmed by time, on both clocks
//!
//! A trail point is dropped when it is older than
//! [`sdroxide_types::AisSettings::trail_minutes`], which happens on *both* the
//! arrival path and the expiry sweep. Only trimming on arrival would leave a
//! ship that stopped reporting frozen with a ten-minute tail behind it forever;
//! only trimming on the sweep would let a fast vessel outrun the cap between
//! sweeps. The point cap is a second, independent bound: a vessel in a traffic
//! separation scheme reports every two seconds, and ten minutes of that is
//! three hundred points times five hundred ships on a message re-sent twice a
//! second.
//!
//! # What the position is *not* compared against
//!
//! Nothing. Unlike ADS-B there is no ambiguous encoding to resolve, no even/odd
//! pair, no reference position: an AIS position report carries an absolute
//! latitude and longitude, and the only judgement made here is whether the
//! numbers are on the earth — which [`crate::message`] has already made.
