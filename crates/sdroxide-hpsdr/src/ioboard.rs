//! The N2ADR **HL2IOBoard**: a Raspberry Pi Pico on the Hermes-Lite 2's
//! accessory connector that switches bands for an external amplifier, a
//! transverter or a loop antenna.
//!
//! The board cannot see either frequency — the Hermes-Lite's own registers never
//! reach it — so the host has to tell it:
//!
//! > The only required SDR modification is sending the transmit frequency. SDR
//! > software must send the transmit frequency to provide band information to
//! > power amps, transverters and loop antennas.
//!
//! Its documentation asks a host for four things, and this does all four:
//!
//! - **Reset** (`REG_CONTROL`) once at startup, since the board's registers are
//!   static and outlive the program that last set them.
//! - **The transmit frequency**, which is what an amplifier switches bands on.
//! - **The receive frequency**, as a one-byte code, which the board uses to
//!   choose a receive antenna and preselector.
//! - **`REG_RF_INPUTS`**, whether the board's own SMA jacks replace the radio's
//!   receive input — the operator's answer to how they wired it.
//!
//! Everything else the board does (which output drives which relay, the fan, the
//! tuner) belongs in the operator's own Pico firmware, deliberately: the author
//! asks that SDR programs *not* grow logic for it.
//!
//! # How the bytes get there
//!
//! Protocol 1 has no direct path to an accessory board, so the Hermes-Lite
//! tunnels I2C through its C&C registers. Register `0x3D` is I2C bus 2 — the one
//! brought out to the accessory connector — and one C&C block carries exactly
//! one one-byte I2C transaction:
//!
//! | byte | meaning |
//! |------|---------|
//! | C0   | `0x3D << 1`, plus the MOX bit and the RQST bit (see below) |
//! | C1   | `0x06` to write, `0x07` to read |
//! | C2   | the 7-bit I2C address of the target |
//! | C3   | the register inside that target |
//! | C4   | the byte to write (unused for a read) |
//!
//! Setting RQST (C0 bit 7) makes the gateware answer, which is the only way to
//! know a command arrived: EP2 is UDP, and an I2C write that fell on the floor
//! would leave the amplifier on the wrong band with nothing to say so. The
//! answer comes back on EP6 with its own ACK bit set, echoing the address —
//! or address `0x3F`, which is the gateware reporting that the transaction
//! failed (nothing acknowledged that I2C address).
//!
//! The Hermes-Lite 2 protocol document asks that only one such request be
//! outstanding at a time, so this runs strictly one transaction at a time.
//!
//! Byte layout and register numbers follow the HL2IOBoard documentation and
//! Quisk's `hermes/quisk_hardware.py`, both by the board's author.
