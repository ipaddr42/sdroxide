//! The burst gate: turns a continuously running channel into discrete
//! transmissions.
//!
//! VDL2 is carrier-sense multiple access. A station listens, transmits for
//! somewhere between three and seventy milliseconds, and is quiet again; even
//! the Common Signalling Channel spends most of its time empty. So the gate
//! watches one channel's baseband power, notices when something arrives, and
//! hands the whole transmission — run-up included — to the decoder as one buffer
//! it can make several passes over.
//!
//! # Why a power gate rather than a continuous search
//!
//! Correlating for the synchronisation word at every sample of every channel
//! would cost fifteen complex multiply-accumulates per trial offset in two
//! spectral senses, on seven channels, forever — some fifty times what this
//! costs, to find bursts on channels that are silent most of the time. The gate
//! is `|z|²` per sample and one comparison per thirty-two of them.
//!
//! # The noise floor
//!
//! A threshold means nothing without a floor, and the floor has to be learned
//! from a channel that is usually quiet and sometimes not. The obvious rule —
//! only update while the gate is shut — deadlocks both ways: seeded too low the
//! gate never shuts and the floor never updates; seeded too high it never opens,
//! and again never updates.
//!
//! So the floor tracks *down fast and up very slowly*. It converges on the
//! quietest power seen recently, which on a channel like this is the noise, and
//! a burst lasting a thousandth of the rise time barely moves it. Min-tracking
//! of a noisy quantity settles below its mean, so the estimate is scaled back up
//! by [`FLOOR_BIAS`] — a constant this module's own test *measures* against
//! noise of known power rather than reasons about and hopes for. The design is
//! the ISM decoder's, with VDL2's numbers; it is not shared code, because that
//! crate links C behind a feature flag and every one of its constants is wrong
//! here.
