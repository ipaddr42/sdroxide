//! D8PSK: the pulse shapes, the interpolating matched filter, and the symbol
//! decision.
//!
//! VDL Mode 2 transmits 10 500 symbols a second, three bits each, as *changes*
//! in carrier phase rather than absolute ones. Eight phase changes, an eighth
//! of a turn apart, Gray-coded so the two symbols either side of a decision
//! boundary differ in one bit — which is what makes the difference between a
//! marginal frame and a lost one, because almost every symbol error is a
//! neighbour error.
//!
//! # Why the symbol position is a fraction
//!
//! A downconverter can only decimate by a whole number, so the samples per
//! symbol are whatever the front end's rate divides down to — 9.14 on an
//! RTL-SDR at 2.4 Msps, 9.64 on an RX-888 — and never a round figure. Rounding
//! 9.64 to 10 slips a symbol every twenty-eight, which over the longest burst is
//! two hundred symbols of drift.
//!
//! And even at an exact ten samples per symbol it would still be a fraction: a
//! transmitter has no idea where this receiver's sample instants are, so a burst
//! starts at a uniformly random sub-sample phase. An interpolating filter is
//! needed either way, and once there is one, a non-integer step costs one
//! addition per symbol. [`Rrc`] is that filter — a bank of sub-sample phases of
//! the same prototype, one evaluation per symbol at wherever the symbol
//! actually lands.
//!
//! # The carrier budget is why a frequency estimate is not optional
//!
//! A decision sector is 45° wide, so a differential decision has ±22.5° of
//! margin. A residual carrier offset of `f` hertz spends `360·f/10500` degrees
//! of it on *every* symbol, so the whole margin goes at
//!
//! ```text
//! 22.5 × 10500 / 360 = 656 Hz
//! ```
//!
//! which at 136.8 MHz is 4.8 parts per million. Avionics are specified at about
//! five; an uncalibrated RTL-SDR is twenty to fifty, up to ten times the entire
//! budget. So the per-burst estimate from the synchronisation word is what makes
//! this work at all, and the decision-directed tracker here is what keeps it
//! working over a long frame.
//!
