//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors, which
//! is the correct answer for this hardware.
//!
//! On an RSPduo with both tuners running, this is also where the two aerials
//! meet: the driver hands back a sample-aligned pair and the adaptive filter
//! in `sdroxide_dsp` turns it into one stream — a noise source nulled, or two
//! fading paths combined (issue #153).
//!
//! Or they do not meet at all. The same two tuners can instead be two radios
//! on two frequencies — HF in one tab, VHF in another — and then each tab has
//! a source of its own on one tuner of one shared session (issue #165). The
//! [`crate::device_registry`] is what pairs the second source with the first
//! one's device, exactly as it does for a TCI rig's second receiver.
