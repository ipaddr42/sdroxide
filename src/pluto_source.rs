//! An [`IqSource`] for one receive chain of an ADALM-Pluto driven over IIOD by
//! the native driver in `sdroxide-pluto` — no libiio, no libSoapySDR.
//!
//! The AD9361 delivers wideband complex I/Q, so this drives the engine's normal
//! DDC/demod path exactly like a SoapySDR device (`audio_mode = false`), and
//! transmit is modulated I/Q rather than audio the rig modulates.
//!
//! The connection is shared: a 2R2T firmware (a Pluto+) streams two receive
//! chains, so two radio tabs on the same address each take one over a single
//! connection — the [`crate::device_registry`] pairs the second source with
//! the first one's rig. What the chains do **not** have is their own LOs: the
//! AD9361's receive chains share one synthesiser, so either radio retuning
//! moves both, and the sibling learns of it through
//! [`sdroxide_radio::ControlUpdate::Center`] — its span simply is somewhere
//! else now. The transmitter belongs to the chain-0 radio.
//!
//! # Zero IF
//!
//! Unlike every other native backend here, the Pluto's front end is zero-IF:
//! LO leakage, DC offset and flicker noise all pile up exactly where the
//! operator's VFO would otherwise sit. So this source does the two things the
//! SoapySDR path does for the same reason — it asks the engine to park the LO a
//! quarter-span away ([`IqSource::lo_offset_hz`]) and DC-blocks the stream
//! before anything downstream sees it.
