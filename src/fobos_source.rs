//! An [`IqSource`] for a RigExpert Fobos SDR driven through `libfobos` by the
//! native driver in `sdroxide-fobos` — no SoapySDR; the vendor library itself
//! is found with dlopen at runtime, matching the SDRplay and LimeSDR
//! backends.
//!
//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors,
//! which is the correct answer for this hardware.
//!
//! RF port, single-channel HF (direct sampling), and dual-channel HF
//! (`FobosPort::HfDual`, both real ADC channels combined by a
//! [`sdroxide_dsp::Diversity`] filter) all work. The combiner lives here
//! rather than inside `sdroxide-fobos` itself — same layer
//! `sdroxide-sdrplay`'s own dual-tuner combining lives at — running the
//! plain adaptive NLMS filter: Cancel or Combine mode, configurable taps
//! and adaptation rate, with a freeze/hold control.
